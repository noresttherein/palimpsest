/** Default implementations of methods of specialized collections which actually require specialization.
  * In general, a hands-off approach is taken and wherever possible, the method delegates to the corresponding
  * method of this instance's iterator, or the builder - received from `CanBuildFrom` or [[FitIterableLike#newBuilder]].
  * In particular, when possible, implementations here try to avoid explicit traverse of this collection and rather
  * pass it as the whole argument to the builder/iterator, which makes it easier to implement various optimizations.
  * Note that iterator-based implementations can be more efficient than those based on [[FitIterableLike#foreach]],
  * as the latter requires passing the computation as a function, which is specialized for fewer argument types
  * than the elements of this collection.
