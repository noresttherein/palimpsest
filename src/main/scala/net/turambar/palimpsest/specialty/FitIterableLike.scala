  * which is the fully specialized version of scala [[IterableLike]], providing similar implementations
  * It exists solely to avoid unnecessary explosion of specialized variants of methods like
  * [[IterableTemplate#foldLeft]], which don't feature `E` as part os their signature and can be implemented efficiently
  * by delegation to another specialized method.

  * @see [[FitIterableLike]] full version of this interface
