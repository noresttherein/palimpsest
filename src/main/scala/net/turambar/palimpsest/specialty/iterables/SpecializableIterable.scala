	  * only when the collection is used through its standard scala interface, the target collection itself is
	  * not specialized, or type `T` is abstract at the point of calling. In each of the result likely all
	  * other parts of the operation (mapping function, appended collections, etc.) are not specialized either.
	  * This could be potentially resolved by [[net.turambar.palimpsest.specialty.FitBuilder.RetardedFitBuilder]]
	  * which can attempt to guess the runtime type representation based on added elements, but it would
	  * require an additional specialized method for the 'real' builder and be useful only in certain cases.
	  * It is probably better to optimise in final implementation classes on a case-by-case basis.
