/** A binary (that is with all inner nodes having arity of `2`) [[Trie]] implementation with `Long` values
  * as keys, using their binary representation as the paths in the tree. Any node in the trie is associated
  * with a prefix of a `Long` value, that is a `Long` which `n` highest bit have specific values, while `64-n`
  * lower bits are set to zero and understood as 'undetermined'. Those prefixes are exposed as [[LongPrefixTrie#prefix]]
  * and are referred to as 'paths' in the trie, as for any two nodes, one is an ancestor of another iff its path
  * is a proper prefix of the path of the descendant. Also, key equality between two node references from a single trie
  * imply that they are the same node instance, so any descendant must extend the length of the common prefix.
  * Also, leaves are always associated with 'full' key values rather than key prefixes (that is, `n==64`), and
  * any branch instances ([[net.turambar.palimpsest.specialty.tries.LongPrefixTrie.LongTrieBranch]])
  * are assumed to always represent inner nodes (associated with a proper prefix of a key
  * and not its full extent). It follows then, that for any trie/subtrie root, the partial key associated with it is
  * a prefix of all keys present in this trie (as leave), and any key which starts with this prefix, if present in a trie,
  * must be a leaf descendant of that node.
