/** A [[LongTrieKeys]] where all keys have their sign (highest) bit flipped before inserting to the trie.
  * As `LongTrieKeys` stores the keys according to 'unsigned' ordering of its keys, flipping their sign bit
  * leads to a trie which is ordered according to natural (two's complement) ordering of `Long`. This results in
  * getting an `OrderedSet`/`OrderedMap` essentially for free. An unfortunate effect is that the term 'key' may now
  * refer to both the internal, flipped key and its public value. In order to differentiate between the two,
  * all methods declared by a standard collection interface (or within [[OrderedBy]]) are assumed to refer to the keys
  * as naturally ordered, while all trie-specific methods work with the flipped values.
  *
  * This trait doesn't take a self type as a parameter in order to be able to serve as a concrete type argument,
  * being a fixed point `OrderedLongKeyedTrie &lt;: LongTrieKeys[OrderedLongKeyedTrie]`. All subclasses
  * representing empty trie, leaves and branches however do take one, which might be thus stated simply as this trait.

	  * This trait is a mixin for leaves of such tries which wish to expose the keys as `key + Long.MinValue` instead.
	  * The `key` property is assumed to be already flipped, and all methods defined by [[Trie]]/[[LongTrieKeys]] are assumed
	  * to work for keys with their sign bit already flipped to avoid problems resulting from flipping it several times.
	  * Instead, the [[OrderedAs]] methods flip the sign bit of all their key arguments. This provides a discrepancy between
