/** A mixin trait for tries which would like to provide generic implementations for binary trie operators
  * working on related types sharing internal structure. Self type `This` parameter is covariant in order
  * to preserve the property that subtries (and return type of many methods) share that type with this instance.
  * This makes it impossible to accept a parameter of this type by any method accessible from the outside
  * of this instance.  On the other hand, there is obviously a need for some upper bound in order for any
  * meaningful comparison to be possible. Hence this trait introduces a second self type `Friend`, being
  * a super type of `This`, which can be compared structurally with any other `Friend` instance, regardless
  * of their proper self types.
  *
  * @tparam K type of keys stored in this trie
  * @tparam This self type of this trie, that is the trie type returned by methods creating tries based solely on this
  *              instance.
  * @tparam Friend super type of `This`, instances of which are interchangeable from its point of view and
  *                which can be compared with this instance.

	/** An operator returning values of `O` for two tries of type `T` which can be implemented by a divide and conquer
	  * algorithm. It is used as a callback argument to method  [[Trie!.juxtapose juxtapose]], which simultaneously traverses
	  * both tries and passes their corresponding subtries to this instance. In this manner, the traversal, aware of
	  * exact details of internal structure of `T` and common to many possible operators such as trie union,
	  * intersection or equality, is separated from the recursive definition of an operator. This results in both
	  * minimization of code repetition and extra flexibility for creating custom trie operations. In particular,
	  * can be used to implement trie union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, as well as relations
	  * of being a subtrie, equality both in terms of key sets and actual nodes (for `Map` implementations).
	  *
	  * In essence, it can be thought of as a recursive map/reduce algorithm. The [[Trie!.juxtapose]] method
	  * is responsible for splitting each of the two tries into a collection of its subtries and pairing them with
	  * corresponding subtries from the other source trie in the following manner:
	  *
	  *   -  key nodes (usually leaves) for keys which a present in both subtries are paired together.
	  *   -  subtries containing disjoint key sets, but for which common longest prefix is longer than the prefix
	  *      associated with the parent of either subtrie, are paired together. In other words, these are two key sets
	  *      such that adding all keys from one to the other source trie would result in 'replanting' of the associated
	  *      subtrie as a sibling of the second subtrie in the two. This represents the case when recursion down the tries
	  *      can be cut short in knowledge that the key sets under each of those subtries must be disjoint and that they
	  *      can be safely joint together under a common parent, which would exist as part of a trie union implementation.
	  *   -  subtries containing keys sharing a prefix which does not exist in the other trie are left by themselves,
	  *      symbolically paired with an empty trie.
	  *
	  *  Each such two marks the termination of recursion and a map step involving invoking an appropriate method of
	  *  this class returning a partial result for that two. These results are then subsequently reduced by pairing
	  *  a result for a given two/subtrie with another of the longest common prefix. More procedurally, recursion
	  *  handles at each step one non-empty node from each trie, starting with whole tries. If the path to one of these
	  *  nodes form a strict prefix of the other, the 'shorter' node is checked for a child which has a longer common
	  *  prefix with the other node. If such a child exists, recursion substitutes it for its parent and continues.
	  *  Additionally, all siblings of the substitute represent prefixes unique to that trie and are paired with empty
	  *  tries for passing to [[TrieOp!.mapFirst]]/[[TrieOp!.mapSecond]], depending if the non-empty child is first or second.
	  *  If the key prefixes (paths in the tries) associated with these nodes differ, recursion stops as their key sets
	  *  are certain to be disjoint and returns result of [[TrieOp!.mapMismatch]]. If both of the nodes are leaves,
	  *  their key must at this step be equal and [[TrieOp!.mapMatch]] is invoked to likewise terminate the recursion.
	  *  In the other case, the children of each node are then examined in search for prefixes which are present in both tries.
	  *  If a child of one node extends the prefix so that the longest common prefix with any child of the other trie
	  *  equals the path of the two parents, it is matched with an empty trie and one of the methods
	  *  [[TrieOp!.mapFirst]]/[[TrieOp!.mapSecond]] are called as before. Otherwise, there is such a child in the other trie
	  *  (there can be at most one), that their common prefix is longer than the prefix to their parents and recursion
	  *  continues for this two. At the end of each step, results for such children pairs are subsequently reduced by
	  *  [[TrieOp!.reduce]]. In addition to partial results, that of the two nodes which has shorter prefix is given as an
	  *  argument. As the reduced two was computed for a two of subtries which have longer prefix with each other than
	  *  with any other key from their corresponding tries, it conceptually represents a prefix node which would be the
	  *  parent of the two in the union of the two tries. In case of binary tries, `reduce` is called exactly once
	  *  at each step; for tries with many potential children it may be called more than once for each such parent argument.
	  *
	  *  For the purpose of simplification, algorithm behaves as if each key ended with a 'end of word' symbol which cannot
	  *  occur anywhere else (that is, keys are stored only in leaves). Moreover, a special case is when one of the
	  *  initial trie arguments to the [[TrieFriends.juxtapose]] is empty. If both are empty, the result of a special method
	  *  [[TrieOp!.mapEmpty]] is returned directly; if only one, than either [[TrieOp!.mapFirst]] or [[TrieOp!.mapSecond]]
	  *  is called for the non empty node.
