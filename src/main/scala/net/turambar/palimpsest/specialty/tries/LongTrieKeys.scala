/** A binary (that is with all inner nodes having arity of `2`) [[Trie]] implementation with `Long` values
  * as keys, using their binary representation as the paths in the tree. Any node in the trie is associated
  * with a prefix of a `Long` value, that is a `Long` which `n` highest bits have specific values, while `64-n`
  * lower bits are set to zero and understood as 'undetermined'. Those prefixes are exposed as [[LongTrieKeys#prefix]]
  * and are referred to as 'paths' in the trie, as for any two nodes, one is an ancestor of another iff its path
  * is a proper prefix of the path of the descendant. Also, key equality between two node references from a single trie
  * implies that they are the same node instance, so any descendant must extend the length of the common prefix.
  * Furthermore, leaves are always associated with 'full' key values rather than key prefixes (that is, `n==64`), and
  * any branch instances ([[net.turambar.palimpsest.specialty.tries.LongTrieKeys.LongKeyBranch]])
  * are assumed to always represent inner nodes (associated with a proper prefix of a key
  * and not its full extent). It follows then that, for any trie/subtrie root, the partial key associated with it is
  * a prefix of all keys present in this trie (as leaves), and any key which starts with this prefix, if present in a trie,
  * must be a leaf descendant of that node.
  *
  * Default, lexicographic ordering of `Long` values translates to 'unsigned' ordering which, when interpreted as
  * signed values in two's complement encoding, puts all negative values after all positive values,
  * while retaining the ordering between values of the same sign. Thus key `k1` is ordered in a trie before key `k2`
  * iff `flip(k1) <= flip(k2)`, where `flip()` changes the sign bit of the argument.
  *
  * This trait as well as its direct descendants focus on the trie structure, ignoring its values and intended usage
  * (like what type of collection it is and if it is mutable or immutable). Concrete implementations will inherit
  * that behaviour from other base traits.
