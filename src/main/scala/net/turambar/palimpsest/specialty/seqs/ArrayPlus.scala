/** An immutable, specialized view on a section of an array with O(1) recursive append/prepend.
  * It is a variation of mutable buffer implementation backed by a growing array with amortized O(1) append,
  * using ownership passing to achieve ''effective'' immutability. A new instance obtained from the companion factory
  * always owns its buffer; first append/prepend operation writes the new data to the shared buffer and passes the
  * ownership of the suffix/prefix of the array to freshly created instance, providing adequate space exists in the
  * array. If appended/prepended data doesn't fit in the buffer, an appropriately larger array is allocated as in
  * a mutable growing buffer, and passed to the new instance after copying all data, with ownership of the old buffer
  * staying with the original sequence. Ownership of the prefix and suffix is tracked independently,
  *
  * It is thus as efficient as its mutable counterpart in one single, but very common scenario, where the final sequence
  * is built by recursively growing an accumulator sequence, for example like:
  * {{{
  * (ArrayPlus.empty[T] /: seqs){ (acc, elems) => acc :++ elems }
  * }}}
  * As such, it's mainly a means for more convenient building of the final sequence without an intermediate
  * builder / linked list, rather than an implementation suited towards common concatenation,
  * as only the first concatenation is guaranteed to be expandable in amortized constant time per element, and only
  * on instances being either returned from a companion factory method or being concatenation results themselves (and not,
  * for example, slices from other sequences). All intermediate values of the accumulator in the above case will cause
  * buffer copying on subsequent expansion. Similarly, any writes or element update takes `O(n)` time.
  *
  * There is one additional feature differentiating this class from other `ArrayView` implementations: slice operations
  * which would require creating a view of only a (small) percentage of this array, reallocate the contents.
  * This is done in order to eliminate the most grievous cases of memory leaks from referenced much larger arrays,
  * which still makes any recursive sequence of slicing (such as traversing the sequence using `tail`) run in amortized
  * `O(1)` time. This makes this class less suitable to algorithms which traverse a sequence repeatedly taking small
  * slices from it, such as in pattern matching. For that purpose, `StableArray` will be more suitable. Methods which
  * convert between them in `O(1)` time exist to facilitate that use scenario.
  *
  * While neither the range, nor the array or its contents within the range of this sequence can be mutated
  * by either this instance or any external source, the contents of the array outside of the  given section
  * are not immutable. Whenever an element is appended/prepended or this instance is concatenated
  * with another sequence, if the backing array has enough space in the corresponding fragment
  * (preceding or succeeding this section) '''and''' this instance ''owns'' the array, new content is simply copied
  * to the underlying array and a view over the whole, extended section is returned as the result sequence, now
  * becoming the whole owner of the underlying section.
  *
  * This class is both effectively immutable and thread safe; the only mutable state is the ownership
  * flag which can only be changed from `true` to `false`.

	/** Computes the new array size when the current array won't fit required elements.

	  * from both sides would require reallocation with each operation. Neither can we always keep the padding,
