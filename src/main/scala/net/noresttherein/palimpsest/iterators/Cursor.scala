/** A bidirectional iterator, declaring the methods for moving in the opposite direction in the iterated collection.
  * As with iterator, a cursor always points between two elements of the collection (or between an element and a boundary
  * of the collection, or nowhere in case of empty iterators). When moving in the opposite direction, [[AptIterator.head]]
  * will return the previously returned element by [[net.noresttherein.palimpsest.iterators.Cursor#prev()]]
  * (or, more correctly, the element following the element which would be returned by the next call to `prev()`).
  * The `head` method itself does not have an equivalent. As with normal iterators, `size`, if defined, specifies the
  * number of elements in front of the cursor, but will generally advance to the 'forward' element of the collection while doing so.
